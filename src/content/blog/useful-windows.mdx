# Removing Windows 11 Watermark
- Access the Registry Editor by typing ‘Regedit’ in the Windows 11 search box and hitting OK to open it.
- On the left side, open up HKEY_CURRENT_USER and scroll down to the Control Panel.
- Find the entry called UnsupportedHardwareNotificationCache.
- Right-click that entry and select ‘Modify’ from the menu.
- Change the SV2 DWORD value from 1 to 0.
- Save, exit, and then restart your PC.

# Basic Optimization Tips

## Turn Off VBS
**Virtualization Based Security (VBS)** can slow apps (and games) down by **5** to **15%** in Windows 11 especially if you're on an AMD system.
- Open System Information. Do this by searching for "system information" in Windows search and clicking the top result.
- Scroll down to find the "Virtualization-based security" row. If it says "running," VBS is enabled. But if it says "not enabled," then you're done.

## Disable VBS/HVCI in Windows 11
- Search for Core Isolation in Windows search and click the top result.
- Toggle Memory Integrity to off, if it was on.
- Reboot your PC as prompted.
- Check System Information again to see if virtualization-based security is listed as "not enabled."
